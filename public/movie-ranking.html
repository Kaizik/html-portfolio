<h3>Super 8</h3>

Movies ipsum The ever impressive, the long contained, often imitated, but never duplicated … Genie of the lamp! The diamond in the rough! For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right. Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. That boy was a criminal. I love the way your foul little mind works! This is not done yet, boy! Phenomenal cosmic powers ... Itty bitty living space.

<h3>Green Mile</h3>
<p>
    How dare you. All of you. Standing around deciding my future. I am not a prize to be won. If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners! My life is but to serve you, my lord. There, there, my dear. We'll set it right. I love the way your foul little mind works! Touch nothing but the lamp. She thinks the monkey is the Sultan. Jasmine, I do love you, but I gotta stop pretending to be something I'm not.
